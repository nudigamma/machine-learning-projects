    "\n",
    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the K-NN as the best model for this data. K-NN has shown high performance throughout the sample training size of 100, 200,300 of f1_score_testing of 0.79, 0.73 and 0.74. SVM-RBF shows higher f1-score for small sample size however it is training time and computing efficiency is almost doubling the size of the data and its prediction time is similar to K-NN. At 300 sample size, K-NN performance is as good as SVM-RBF with less prediction time and training time.\n",
    "Adaptive boosting performed better than K-NN for all training sample size, slightly outperforming K-NN for a training sample size of 300. However, the training_time is much bigger than the training time for K-NN and also the prediction time is twice as the K-NN.\n",
    "Given the limited resources cost and performance I would say the K-NN is the best model. Please note that Adaptive boosting training time is almost 50 ms, on an Intel i7 four cores. I consider this setup as a standard computing  configuration. Depending on the available hardware of the school and the available data , I would say Ada-boosting is the best choice, however if the number of data will increase then the best choice so far will be K-NN .\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model was chosen is supposed to work (for example, if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN algorithm stands for K nearest neighbors, where K is the number of neighbors that are taken into consideration while classifying a student. Neighbors have close properties to the data we are trying to predict. For example let us assume we have five students with absences: 10, 12,20, 2,5  and the first three failed an exam while the last two passed. A student with 15 absences will most likely fail an exam, and a student of 4 absences will most likely pass an exam. The student with 15 absences will most likely fail the exam because for K = 3, or the closest three neighbors have 10, 12 and 20 absences, and they failed the exam. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the student with four absences might pass the exam because for K =2, or the closest two neighbors passed the exam.\n",
    "Now for the case of a student with six absences what K-NN might predict?  It will depend on the number of neighbors we will take into consideration. If we take k = 3, the nearest neighbors are  students with 10 absences, 5 and 2 absences where one has failed, and the other two have passed respectively; the student will most likely pass the exam, however, if we take into consideration all five neighbors k =5, the student will most likely fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least three settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important parameter to tune in K-NN is the number of neighbors.also if we need to weight the distances from the neighbors or not. \n",
    "- What is the model's final F<sub>1</sub> score?\n",
    "0.79, which is better than for the default setting neighbors =5; "
